The task of this assignment is to implement a command line chat system, based on TCP.

Steps to be followed :

Run the chatserver using the command "python chatserver.py hostname:port", where the hostname and the port are the deatils of the device on which we are going to start the server.

Then run the chatclient using the command "python chatclient.py hostname:port nickname", where the hostname and the port are the details of the server we want the client to connect.

We can run multiple clients on single server.
